# twdesktop

twdesktop is a desktop app to provide a convenient way to access your [tiddly wikis](http://www.tiddlywiki.com) in one click (well, okay two to be honest).

This [electron](https://www.electron.atom.io) app will live in your tray, providing a fast and non intrusive access to all of your tiddly wiki files. Auto-save on change included.

**IMPORTANT**

Right now only tiddlywiki5 is supported.  
(`tiddlywiki classic` can be opened but not saved.)

## Actual feature set

[x] Register multiple wiki files  
[x] Open every Wikis in it's own window  
[x] Autosave wikis on change  
[x] Create tray contextmenu entry for every registered wiki (show/hide)  
[x] Define default wiki (show/hide on left-click of tray icon)  
[x] Change color of tray icon (light/dark)  
[x] Keep wiki open in background (instead of closing it completely)  

## Planned features
